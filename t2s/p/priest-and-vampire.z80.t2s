; 7805 is the address of the 'OUT (C),A' instruction that performs the
; 'OUT (254),255' command in line 120 of the BASIC loader. Starting here
; (instead of the game's true start address at 53300) is required to make the
; game's keyboard-reading routines work. (The Z80 snapshot format has no slot
; for the last OUT to port 0xFE.)
